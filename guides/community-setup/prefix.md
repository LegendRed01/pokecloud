description: How to change a servers default prefix from the "$" symbol.

# Prefix

The default bot prefix is **`$`** and can be changed at any time. If you do not wish to change the prefix, feel free to skip over this part of the guide.

{% hint style="danger" %}
#### PokeCloud requires a prefix to function. Without it, the bot will not know when you are talking to it and can not give out any responses.
{% endhint %}

> _**The prefix can be whatever you want ex: "!", "%bot", "$!cloud", etc...**_

_It is recommended to not use `#` as this is already a feature within discord and `,` as it is used throughout the bot and may mess up some commands._ 

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Full Command" %}
```
$set-prefix <new prefix>
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Alias" %}
```
$spf <new prefix>
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Example" %}
```
$spf !
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}
