# Search Nests

All nests created by servers is considered to be public data. No outside source has access to this data however, any server that uses PokeCloud can view nest data by using the **`search-nest`** command.

### Command Usage

**`REQUIRED`**An argument is used to determine what type of search will be performed.

{% hint style="success" %}
**Arguments**

**`city` \| `state` \| `pokemon`**
{% endhint %}

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Full Command" %}
```text
$search-nests <argument>, <your input>, [all]
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Alias" %}
```text
$sn <argument>, <your input>, [all]
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

_**There are multiple ways to search nests. See the next steps in this guide to learn more about how default and advance searching works as well as examples using each argument.**_
